# Multiavatar
#### Brief

Generate a random avatar based on the characters entered

I used a repository code for avatar generation learning because the [original author's website](https://github.com/multiavatar/Multiavatar) was too slow to access

#### Usage

visit my website: http://119.91.232.147:8095

if you want generate a random avatar based on the characters entered, add some characters to website,

for example, http://119.91.232.147:8095/tony, or http://119.91.232.147:8095/tony.png, it will return a picture of tony's name

if you accessed directly http://119.91.232.147:8095, it will return a picture of the timestamp name
